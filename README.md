# Ariel

Specification and prototype interpreter for an experimental programming language featuring:

- Strict (call-by-value) evaluation.

- Purity through "monadic" IO.

- Structural types.

- Full type inference.

- Row polymorphism.

- Generic (as in Haskell's `Generic`) functions.

# Status

The project is still in a very early phase.
